# a summary about you
summary: 'My name is Artiom, I also sometimes use the nickname Master Splinter üêÄ ü•ã, the wise rat-teacher from the Ninja Turtles. This is my personal website, where you can find both professional information and personal reflections. The posts section contains publications on topics of interest to me, including an outline of my life''s "Philosophy" and "Metaphorical Autobiography".<br>Because of the specifics of my life experiences, it can be difficult to find the exact words to express myself, so I use metaphors. But first, a bit of formal introduction:<br><br><blockquote> Artiom Kovnatsky, PhD, is a highly skilled Data Scientist and Business Analyst with extensive experience in providing complex data services. I specialise in data science, business analysis, MLOps and consulting. Known for my ability to extract business value from "bad" or "sparse" data even in challenging environments. I successfully deliver high-risk projects while meeting deadlines and ensuring the highest quality. Demonstrate leadership in building and mentoring cross-functional teams to achieve strategic goals, using innovative tools and methodologies with a focus on efficiency.</blockquote> <br><br>Now that the formal part is complete, I''ll move on to the informal part. My life developed in such a way that every 3-6 months, and sometimes several times a day, I figuratively speaking "moved" to a "new country". I had to constantly learn, adapt, improvise and solve problems with minimal resources. What they teach in smart books about startups - flexibility, strategic thinking, ability to work with limited resources, attention to detail and anticipation of opportunities - became a matter of survival for me. These skills are honed in me to perfection.<br><br>However, man is not only built for survival, but also for life. Therefore, for a long time I have been engaged in developing my inner world, practising meditation and spiritual practices to find harmony with myself and the world around me. In July 2020, I dedicated myself to a deep practice that helped me resolve inner contradictions and find answers to important questions. During this process, I temporarily "stepped out of society". However, I have decided to return to share what I realised and to live among people. I hope I will be able to communicate my thoughts through articles, videos, lectures, presentations and entrepreneurship. <br>I look forward to making new connections and "resetting" old ones!<br><br>You can schedule an appointment using Calendly <a href="https://calendly.com/artiom_kovnatsky" target="_blank">here</a>, or through Read.ai <a href="https://cal.read.ai/artiomkovnatsky" target="_blank">here</a>.'
