# summary: 'My name is Artiom, I also sometimes use the nickname Master Splinter üêÄ ü•ã, the wise rat-teacher from the Ninja Turtles. This is my personal website, where you can find both professional information and personal reflections. The posts section contains publications on topics of interest to me, including an outline of my life''s "Philosophy" and "Metaphorical Autobiography".<br>Because of the specifics of my life experiences, it can be difficult to find the exact words to express myself, so I use metaphors. But first, a bit of formal introduction:<br><br><blockquote> Artiom Kovnatsky, PhD, is a highly skilled Data Scientist and Business Analyst with extensive experience in providing complex data services. I specialise in data science, business analysis, MLOps and consulting. Known for my ability to extract business value from "bad" or "sparse" data even in challenging environments. I successfully deliver high-risk projects while meeting deadlines and ensuring the highest quality. Demonstrate leadership in building and mentoring cross-functional teams to achieve strategic goals, using innovative tools and methodologies with a focus on efficiency.</blockquote> <br><br>Now that the formal part is complete, I''ll move on to the informal part. My life developed in such a way that every 3-6 months, and sometimes several times a day, I figuratively speaking "moved" to a "new country". I had to constantly learn, adapt, improvise and solve problems with minimal resources. What they teach in smart books about startups - flexibility, strategic thinking, ability to work with limited resources, attention to detail and anticipation of opportunities - became a matter of survival for me. These skills are honed in me to perfection and is the case for speciality - "Survival Economics".<br><br> Hence my target audience is:<br> <ol> <li>Startups and companies in critical condition, struggling to survive and/or pivoting.</li> <li>Companies dealing with imperfect data and/or rare cases.</li> <li>Companies handling complex data and developing data products.</li> </ol> <br>However, man is not only built for survival, but also for life. Therefore, for a long time I have been engaged in developing my inner world, practising meditation and spiritual practices to find harmony with myself and the world around me. In July 2020, I dedicated myself to a deep practice that helped me resolve inner contradictions and find answers to important questions. During this process, I temporarily "stepped out of society". However, I have decided to return to share what I realised and to live among people. I hope I will be able to communicate my thoughts through articles, videos, lectures, presentations and entrepreneurship. <br>I look forward to making new connections and "resetting" old ones!<br><br>You can schedule an appointment using Calendly <a href="https://calendly.com/artiom_kovnatsky" target="_blank">here</a>, or through Read.ai <a href="https://cal.read.ai/artiomkovnatsky" target="_blank">here</a>.' #<br>Your\''s, Art the Rat!

summary: 'My name is Artiom, I also sometimes use the nickname Master Splinter üêÄ ü•ã, the wise rat-teacher from the Ninja Turtles. This is my personal website, where you can find both professional information and personal reflections.<br> The posts section contains stories with examples of my services and publications on topics of interest to me, including an outline of my life''s "Philosophy" and "Metaphorical Autobiography".<br>Thanks to my unique life experiences, I often see things from perspectives others might overlook, noticing details that frequently remain unseen. I consider myself a "Navigator in the World of Hidden Opportunities". However, this distinct viewpoint can sometimes make it challenging to articulate my thoughts precisely, leading me to rely on metaphors. But first, a brief formal introduction:<br><br><blockquote>Artiom Kovnatsky, PhD, is a highly skilled and innovative Data Scientist and Business Analyst with a talent for uncovering hidden insights and activating data to drive strategic decisions. I specialize in data science, business analysis, MLOps, and consulting, and am recognized for my ability to extract business value from imperfect or sparse data, even in challenging environments. My expertise lies in discovering unseen opportunities and delivering impactful solutions. With a strategic mindset and a creative approach, I have a proven track record of leading teams to success and managing high-stakes projects with precision. Proficient in various tools and methodologies, I focus on driving efficiency and results.</blockquote> <br><br>With the formal part behind us, let''s dive into the more personal side. My life has been a series of constant shifts, like "moving" to a "new country" every 3-6 months, and sometimes even multiple times a day ‚Äî figuratively speaking. Each of these "countries" had vastly different "inhabitants", "cultures", and levels of predictability, including extreme scenarios resembling "war zones". I was continually learning, adapting, improvising, and solving problems with minimal resources, often leveraging my knack for uncovering hidden opportunities. What''s taught in startup books ‚Äî seeing opportunity in crisis, strategic thinking, adaptability, working with limited resources, and keen attention to detail ‚Äî wasn''t just theory for me; it was survival. These skills became second nature, honed to perfection. Some might say I''ve mastered the art of "navigating the world of hidden opportunities" and "Survival Economics".<br><br>I''m here to help those seeking an alternative perspective on business or personal issues, such as:<br> <ol> <li>You want to monetize your data and need a way to "activate" it</li> <li>You''re considering a pivot and are looking for promising options and strategies you might have missed</li> <li>You have incomplete or flawed data and need methods to extract valuable insights</li> <li>You''re in a crisis and need an unbiased, detached perspective from someone experienced in spotting hidden opportunities in challenging situations</li> <li>You''re facing a personal struggle and need someone who understands hardship, can listen, and propose possible solutions</li> <li>Despite your efforts, your outcomes aren''t satisfying ‚Äî this could signal a crucial blind spot that I may be able to identify and address</li> <li>You need feedback on your grant or strategic proposal, with insights on where to focus your arguments</li> <li>You''re dealing with a unique case not covered by conventional sources like Google or ChatGPT</li> <li>Businesses dealing with complex data and building data-centric products</li> </ol> <br>Surviving or "navigating hidden worlds" is only part of the journey; truly living is the real aim. I''ve long been dedicated to nurturing my inner world through meditation and spiritual practices, seeking harmony with myself and the world. In July 2020, I immersed myself in deep practice, which enabled me to resolve internal contradictions and find clarity on key questions. This path led me to temporarily "step away from society". However, I''ve now decided to rejoin and share what I''ve learned, aiming to connect through my services, writings, videos, lectures, and entrepreneurial ventures. <br>I look forward to making new connections and "resetting" old ones!<br><br>You can explore examples of my services in the stories [below](#featured-posts), and schedule an appointment using Calendly <a href="https://calendly.com/artiom_kovnatsky" target="_blank">here</a>, or through Read.ai <a href="https://cal.read.ai/artiomkovnatsky" target="_blank">here</a>.' #<br>Your''s, Art the Rat!
