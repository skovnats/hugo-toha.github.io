### **_Questions:_**

- _what "colors" can be used to paint the future_
- _why "...isms" are not a solution_
- _why hypotheses, and not "I know"_

### **From the author**

[Earlier, the main question was raised: why and how do we interact with each other?](#lodka) Here, I will "paint" a possible image of the future with "colors." I will use two "types" of "colors." To "draw" a picture of the future, it is enough to describe the foundation:

- meanings — **what is good?**
- values — **what is valuable?**
- metaphysical "mythological history" — **why?** and **for what?**
- "vector" — **what is "improvement"?**

<blockquote>
Sometimes instead of words, all you get is "mumbling"... and you need to "mumble" for a while before finding the right words for new inner content.

[_S. Pereslegin_](https://boosty.to/psychotechnology)
</blockquote>

Perhaps, this lecture — presentation, is exactly my "mumbling."

### **Lecture — presentation (draft):**
{{< youtube uY5gXpgKuno >}}<br>


### **Expanded text — summary of the video lecture**

#### **_Type 1_**

<blockquote>
Everything has already been said, but we did not "hear" it or did not "believe" it.
</blockquote>

_"The image of the future" should be "simple" and "naturally"_—_"beautiful", like a woman, like nature. For each person, there will probably be their own meanings and beauty:_

- _the "professor" will "see" in it deep interesting questions and theories_
- _the "soldier" will find a reason to live and "fight"_
- _the "policeman" will feel the importance of his work and the gratitude of the people_
- _a mother will want to give her daughter another brother_
- _the "artist" will paint and create_
- _the "Marxist" will see the possibility of realizing his ideas_
- _the "capitalist" will see sustainable long-term profit_
- _the "investor" will see potential_
- _the "famous journalist" will find motivation to risk her life for this_
- _someone who grew up without parents or without a father will find motivation to become the best version of themselves and build the family they never had_
- _the "politician" will see his children happy in the world he "builds" and leaves behind_
- _the "famous producer" will see that he didn't risk everything in vain_
- _the "famous businessman" will see the opportunity for a good, dignified life for himself and his family... perhaps some will even want to share their resources, skills, and experience as mentorship for the next generation_
- _the "little boy" will want to "print" it on a card, "draw a heart" on it, and give it to the "girl" from the neighboring building, the one he was too shy to approach, who walks to kindergarten with him_
- _..._
- _and someone, perhaps, will "see" God in it ("the handwriting")_

_Such "perspectives" and deep meanings are infinitely many there. With or without "complex words," this image can be described._

##### **The Image of the Future: "Ω — Family"**

<blockquote>
Family is a state in miniature.

_A. T. Averchenko_
</blockquote>

<figure id="fig1">
    <img src="/posts/omega/opa/fig/fig1.jpeg" alt="Description of the image" style="width:99%; display: block; margin: auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">"Ω — Family" — Perspective</figcaption>
</figure><br>

<blockquote>
"Ω — Family" — "One big family, living in one big shared home."
</blockquote>

Thus, **family** is both the **foundation** and at the same time the **aspiration**. Therefore, **traditions** and **lineage** are very important. We complement and help each other, learning the best from everyone and supporting each other in "difficult times," sharing "worldviews," "traditions," "advice," "resources"...

<figure id="fig2">
    <img src="/posts/omega/opa/fig/fig2.png" alt="Description of the image" style="width:99%; display: block; margin: auto;">
</figure><br>

Therefore, **the concept of family is central**.

"Family" is needed to raise a "child," and "Ω — Family" is needed to "raise" the "Creative Human."

<blockquote>
Human — Creator

_(...in the image of God)_

_*creation, not destruction and degradation_
</blockquote>

"Ω — Family" consists of families... and families consist of people, the "members of 'Ω — Family.'"

- **Meanings** — What is good?

What is good for the "family" and the "future of children."

- **Values** — What is valuable?

What makes the life of the "family" "better, happier, healthier, more joyful."

- **Metaphysical 'mythological history'** — Why? And for what?

We are already "one family and brothers and sisters"... isn't that what the wise and prophets have said? Fulfillment of prophecy and reaching a "life" that is "spiritually filled and meaningful," "having satisfied material needs"... coming to "God" or perhaps to "cherished dreams."

- **Vector** — What is "improvement"?

Something that is "not worse than before," based on "feedback from all family members." In this "scheme," there is a "cautious, progressive" movement "forward," grounded in the "past," "taking all the good from it."

We love acronyms — **USSR**, as a variant if aiming for "Ω — Family": **U**nion of **C**reative "**F**amily **R**epublics."

<blockquote>
Like death, the mystery of family remains unresolved. Dynasties, societies, empires turned to dust if family began to crumble within them.

_V. P. Astafyev_
</blockquote>

##### **Capitalism vs Marxism vs Anarchism vs ...**

<blockquote>
It is difficult to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if it's not there.
</blockquote>

The question of _which "...ism" is better_ is fundamentally flawed.

<blockquote>
Any "rigid system" in an "open world" will "break."

[_A. Redozubov_](https://boosty.to/aldrd)
</blockquote>

Any "ism" is a concept... perhaps useful, but a concept nonetheless. A human being is more complex than any concept... as is "reality." Thinking within the framework of "isms" is unsustainable in the long term because humans and/or "reality" are very complex... and change over time.

<blockquote>
Just as there is disease of the body, there is also disease of lifestyle.

_Democritus_
</blockquote>

##### **Conflicts**

Any "ism" can be imagined as a social game: it has "roles," "duties," "rights," "rules," "values," "rewards," and so on. Conflict arises where there is a request to find a "new point of collective consensus" — a "balance."

<blockquote>
Any "unbalanced" (social) game leads to "conflicts."
</blockquote>

Conflicts can be resolved in three ways:

1. _"Exiting" the "rules" and "roles" of this "game" and "rebuilding" a "new game."_
2. Physical elimination of "conflicting roles/functions."
3. _A "hybrid" between 1 and 2._

I'm interested in 1, while 2 and 3 are possible if there is **aggression** that prevents 1 from being achieved.

Let's take a simplified example using the game of chess.

<figure id="fig3">
    <img src="/posts/omega/opa/fig/fig3.jpeg" alt="Description of the image" style="width:99%; display: block; margin: auto;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Perspective</figcaption>
</figure><br>

When "playing" within the framework of the "chess game," we are **inevitably** "enemies" and "act" only within the "prescribed" roles: the knight moves in an "L" shape, the bishop moves "diagonally"... According to [Einstein’s Law No. 9 on Problem-Solving and System Analysis](#lodka), "conflict" cannot be resolved within this "game." To "resolve" it, one must "step outside" the prescribed roles.

</figure><br>

<blockquote>
People seek pleasure, darting from side to side, only because they feel the emptiness of their life, but they do not yet feel the emptiness of the new amusement that draws them in.

_B. Pascal_
</blockquote>

**Lyrical Digression**

If I were growing up "again" and there were "summer programs" to live with my class in other republics (Altai, Chechnya, Kuban, Yakutia, Switzerland, Normandy, Africa...) funded by the "state," I would gladly take advantage of such an opportunity to better understand and learn from other cultures. I would study other languages (Chechen, Bashkir, Ukrainian...) to better understand "ultimately life... and myself" and later find a "common language."

<blockquote>
"I see Russian culture and language as a 'metaphorical bridge for finding common ground between all cultures'... 'on equal terms.'"
</blockquote>

##### **"Balance" in "Games"**

<blockquote>
"A game is 'balanced' if none of the participants are 'against' starting with 'randomly selected roles'."
</blockquote>

Continuing the chess example: chess is not a balanced game because there is an inherent advantage to starting with one set of pieces, reflected in the known advantage of one side or "role." To "balance" it, an even number of games is played, with alternating rights for the first move.

"Balance" in the "game" implies that within a "finite" number of "moves," each "participant" can switch their "role" to another "one they like" (there are no "objective" obstacles derived from the "game's limitations" preventing "anyone" from becoming "wealthy"/"mayor"/"singer"/"president"/"professor," etc.).

In the chess example: in a match of "2-4-6-8-..." games, "Player A" can become both the winner and the loser, and this will depend "exclusively" on their "individual skills"—the format of the game gives no inherent advantages, as both "Player A" and "Player B" will have an equal number of games starting as "white" and "black," "4/4". Therefore, each is "agreeable" to a "random" decision regarding the first move in the first game.

<blockquote>
People live in such complete misunderstanding of the vanity of all human life that they are completely bewildered when told about the futility of pursuing honors. Is it not remarkable?

_B. Pascal_
</blockquote>

##### **About "Bases"**

The basis of any "ism" can be determined by answering three questions:

1. **Who am I**?

2. **Why do I** interact with others?

3. **How do I** interact with others?

"As many people as there are, there are that many 'answers'." Also, the "answer" depends on the level of a person's development at a given moment in their "personal" time, (historical) time, emotions, context, other people, tasks, and much more. Answers can (and do) change over time and in different contexts.

<blockquote>
"...ism" is a "vector" sum of "individual" "answers-vectors" to 1-3.
</blockquote>

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 4: "Black vector" — "Marxism" expressed as a "vector" within a "reference group consisting mainly of Marxists, represented by individual vectors," shown in terms of bases in the value-meaning cognitive space.</figcaption>
</figure><br>

##### **I Know vs I Assume**

Any "...ism," "answer," or "concept" is a **hypothesis** about reality and/or humans/people. There are "infinitely" many "concepts" and their "variations": [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism), [Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism), [anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism), [social threefolding](https://en.dreigliederung.de/), [dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship), [communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism), [anthroposophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposophy), [Greek myths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology), etc. Whether someone likes it or not, almost "all" "concepts"-"answers" in certain contexts, for certain collective tasks, for certain people, may be useful and advantageous.

It’s more accurate to think of "...isms" as **HYPOTHESES** for solving "[collective cognitive](https://boosty.to/psychotechnology) and/or physical tasks." Therefore, the correct question is:

_How can we create such a toolkit to solve various collective cognitive tasks efficiently: quickly formulating "collective hypotheses" to solve "collective cognitive tasks," implementation, testing, gathering and processing feedback, adjustment and changes in implementation, repeating the cycle?_

The approach should be scientific.

<blockquote>
There is no national science, just as there is no national multiplication table; what is national is not science.

_A. P. Chekhov_
</blockquote>

##### **Solving Collective Cognitive Tasks**

<blockquote>
People are not equal... but people are equal

Explanation: We are not equal... some are more intelligent in certain areas, some are better at making music, algorithms, creating and managing large projects... "anyone" can be a "teacher."
</blockquote>

Collective cognitive tasks will likely always exist, and their level of "complexity" may increase over time.

There are 3 ways to "reach agreements":

1. Agree "without violence"
2. Agree with "hybrid violence"
3. Agree with "violence"

The second method has a boundary that tends to either the first or the third in the limit. The third method ends with the "final violence" — death. If an "opponent" has the ability to "take the other with them," there will be a mutual "end." Thus, in systems where a "player" can "take the opponent with them," the first option is the only one that, in the limit, does not lead to a "mutual end." In other words, in such a "system":

<blockquote>
In the end, you will have to reach an agreement — it's a matter of time... or mutual destruction.
</blockquote>

Note that I am not excluding aggression and war. I define violence as the forcible violation of another's will, but if the participants agree to "fight/compete," it is not violence but "aggression." The same applies to wars where there is an "attack." In this concept, aggression is acceptable, but it is directed toward "non-violence" and/or "defense."

##### **Vecheism**

Since we "love" "..isms," I propose calling the implementation of method 1 "[Vecheism](https://ru.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%B5)." "Vecheism" is a mechanism for reaching "contractual" "collective consensus" to solve "collective cognitive tasks" (including a "force component" to avoid "Fig. 3").

<figure id="fig6">
    <img src="/posts/omega/opa/fig/fig6.jpeg" alt="Description of the image" style="width:55%; display: block; margin: auto;">

    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 6 A "slider" graph for "isms" within the "organizational constructor" from Fig. 5</figcaption>
</figure><br>

Unlike other "isms," Vecheism does not assume predefined roles within any specific "ism" but is based on a family model of decision-making regarding collective hypotheses and implementation — beginning with what we strive for, "Ω — family." It is founded on three principles:

1. **Truth** (the pursuit of truth, primarily with oneself)
2. **Justice** (the pursuit of justice, understanding that it may differ for everyone)
3. **Honor** (the pursuit of "living by conscience," to live according to one's "soul," without betraying it)

<blockquote>
In nature, everything is wisely thought out and arranged; everyone should do their own thing, and in this wisdom lies the highest justice of life.

_Leonardo da Vinci_
</blockquote>

Agreements reached ("shaking hands") at a veche (assembly) must be fulfilled, as in "a given word must be kept" or "standing by your word."

**Family**:

**God** (the one "parents" listen to; a set of "principles and rules" — "do not kill, do not steal...")

"**Parent**" - veto power ("parents do not interfere in children's decisions but teach them to mature by warning against obvious mistakes based on their rich experience") — 25% "profit" (e.g., "investors" or "founders of large projects"... those who have much to offer/teach others — the "children")

"**Older children**" - 3 votes — 25% "profit" (e.g., "directors" or "top management")

"**Middle children**" - 3 votes — 25% "profit" (e.g., "employees" or "participants")

"**Younger children**" - 3 votes — 25% "profit" (e.g., "consumers")

Vecheism is a method for selecting and testing "collective hypotheses" that can be implemented on blockchain. Importantly, when making decisions, feedback mechanisms are also established, which can be gathered through mobile devices, allowing quicker assessment of whether "progress is in the right direction." The system will store experiences and interaction "templates" and suggest pre-made collaboration "templates" with the possibility of modification (as seen with Miro, Notion, DAO constructors, etc.). The results of collective work are distributed within the blockchain system (also used for voting, feedback, and more).

In the process of "growing," a person can "mature" or become a "parent." Existing companies (e.g., Sberbank, Gazprom) can be reformatted into "Vecheism" while retaining their current structure, but now everyone "benefits from the success of the family business... including financially." This can start with a small enterprise in one location, leading to conclusions and adaptations, and gradually tested in other contexts, considering the unique characteristics of each case.

<blockquote>
I have never met a person who didn't have something to teach.

_Alfred de Vigny_
</blockquote>

##### **Vecheism — Our Proposal to the World**
<blockquote>
If you desire it, you cannot separate your life from humanity. You live within it, by it, and for it. We are all made to cooperate, like feet, hands, and eyes. People exist for each other.

_Marcus Aurelius_
</blockquote>

Considering our people's distaste for rigid disciplinary systems, Vecheism offers both flexibility and a foundation close to our hearts (justice — truth — honor). This is something we can "offer" the world as an alternative. Moreover, we are not limited to any specific structure and can take the best from everything already invented, while also creating new "isms" and testing them efficiently (perhaps starting small, adjusting, and scaling up — something that may have been missing in the USSR for the gradual implementation of changes).

It seems that our people value "substance" more than "form." Perhaps this is why terms like PR, marketing, branding, and the like weren't "invented" in our culture but were imported. These concepts focus on "form," an area where we lag behind other cultures. Perhaps we should "accept ourselves as we are": why would we need something, even if it "sounds," "smells," or "feels" good, if it lacks justice, truth, and honor? Maybe, to solve "collective cognitive tasks," we should start with the foundation: justice — truth — honor, and select the "form" based on the situation, relying on "feedback and experience" from others.

The basis of Vecheism is an "organizational constructor" (based on blockchain) with fast feedback. Smart contracts reduce "bureaucracy," outlining all "roles," "legal nuances and templates," allowing the creation of any organization ([LLC](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE_%D1%81_%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8E_%28%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F%29), [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization), etc.) with just a few clicks and concluding contracts (using electronic signatures). [Initial groundwork is already underway](https://copenomics.world/). The establishment of any form of interaction, modification, and more will be predefined and integrated into the legal system, significantly speeding up task resolution.

</figure><br>

Templates, feedback, recommendations, "experience" in task-solving in different contexts, and more are shared among all participants. All code is Open Source, meaning others can "program" their own "organizations," "hypotheses," "..isms," and more — this is collective work for the common good. All forms of interaction are checked for legality, as are all smart contracts. The organization's activity reports can be open to the "widest possible audience," depending on the context.

_Daniel Defoe_

##### **Justice**

Russia advocates for a multipolar world. Perhaps the word "justice" is intentionally left out (i.e., a "more just world") so as not to accidentally look into the mirror and see an unflattering reflection.

As the saying goes, "you can't take words out of a song," and as we used to say in Mykolaiv:

<blockquote>
Before you make claims, make sure you can back up your words.
</blockquote>

Also:

<blockquote>
You must be accountable for your words:
</blockquote>

**Perhaps we should strive for "no less justice" internally than "within" our opponents, not only in geopolitics.**

It seems that "hot phases of confrontation" were not our weak point, but rather the "cold phases of struggle." When the "hot phase" ends, if there is no striving for justice (whatever it may be called in form) "internally," this will, in the long run, lead to an accumulation of internal contradictions with the risk of repeating our past mistakes. Personally, I felt ashamed when I still lived in Ukraine\*, seeing how our pensioners and others lived.

<figure id="fig13">
    <img src="/posts/omega/opa/fig/fig13.jpeg" alt="Description of the image" style="width:77%; display: block; margin: auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">\*on/in Ukraine: I say it "the old-fashioned way," as we used to say "in the yard and beyond" in Mykolaiv.</figcaption>
</figure><br>

\*\*According to [newspeak v10.01](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_%28%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%29), the correct way to say it is "in Ukraine"; I haven't "retrained" myself yet; [1984](https://kinogo.biz/21732-1984.html).

I don't see "just" reasons why enterprises extracting natural resources should not share profits with all people in the "USSR." Note, I'm not claiming I'm right, maybe there's a "perspective" (read: arguments) from which such a situation seems fair — in that case, it needs to be taken into account.

If the owners do not want to reformat their enterprises into a "family version or something similar" — that's fine. Some people need to own "newspapers, factories, and steamships"... it happens... the main thing is that it passes..., we can wait 11-111 years until they are gone — no one has taken anything with them yet. After that, various options can gradually be tested, if there is a demand.

<blockquote>
Life is a gift from the few to the many, from those who know and can do, to those who don’t know and cannot do.

_A. Modigliani_
</blockquote>

##### **Anthropotype and Justice**
<blockquote>
To live means not only to satisfy the material demands of the body but primarily to be aware of one’s human unity.

_J. Verne_
</blockquote>

Without increasing justice, the accumulated internal contradictions are "suppressed" by redirecting attention and "righteous anger" towards a "common enemy," whether internal, external, or hybrid. This is achieved by shaping an anthropotype of a person — a "dopamine addict" with a low level of critical thinking, ideally with a (cognitive) "trauma." This is practiced to varying degrees by all states, with some achieving greater success (Ukraine, USA, Russia), and others less so (Switzerland).

It’s also "common" to "export" internal contradictions, tension, and problems abroad (for example, through financial-insurance systems, legislation) while "importing" resources (such as human capital, minerals).

"Masculinity" and "male aggression" are a "threat" to the "status quo" — the system, which is why the fostered anthropotype will be a "castrated man"/"feminized," which will be "encouraged."

There seem to be more worthy targets for righteous anger than "Jew against Palestinian," "Azerbaijani against Armenian," "Ukrainian against Russian," and vice versa. For instance, slavery (we’ve broken the "historical record" for the number of slaves in the world), child and human trafficking, organ trafficking from children, pedophilia among the "elite," "satanism" and/or misanthropy, and world hunger. When I was little, it was "Africa is starving," at age 10 - "Africa is starving," at 20 - "Africa is starving," at 30 - "Africa is starving"; and now I’m 40, "Africa is still starving."

I know of few problems that cannot be solved in 40 years (!!!). If this problem hasn’t been solved (hunger in Africa), then it is **beneficial** to the beneficiaries of the existing world order (e.g., grain brokers from England ...; traders on exchanges in England, Switzerland ...; consumers of cheap resources from Africa, both minerals and human...).

##### **Forgiveness and Compassion**

Ivanov stole — imprison him, Petrov also — "execute," Rabinovich embezzled — "bloodsuckers"... It seems to me that if you took "10 people from the street," perhaps they would "steal" just as much. The issue, then, lies in our mindset and values.

Someone loves "newspapers, factories, and steamships" (personally, I don't need this, I give up "my share" to them)... it happens, as long as it passes.

Undoubtedly, people who have reached high positions, possessing "newspapers, factories, and steamships," are extraordinary and talented in their own way. Perhaps we should gradually "reset the social contract," release such a person if they have "repented and want to do something for the benefit of people," and try to find an application for their talents (maybe they're a talented schemer, and such skills are needed in foreign affairs or elsewhere). This way, they can continue to own "newspapers, factories, and steamships," while society also benefits. It seems that if society openly offered this person 200 million instead of stealing 1 billion, and they applied their "true" talents where needed, everyone would benefit.

Everyone exclaims: where is the person who will save us? We need a person! Do not seek this person. They are right in front of you. This person is you, me, each of us! How to make yourself a true human? Nothing is more difficult if you don't know how to want it; nothing is easier — if you want it.

Our children are also our "parents" in certain contexts, perhaps even our greatest "teachers": there is much we can learn from them — for example, preschoolers from "Ukraine," "Russia," "Israel," "Palestine," "Turkey," "America," "Greece," "Armenia," "Azerbaijan"... would likely easily find "common ground" while playing, and after their schooling... Likewise, a boy from Africa, scoring his first goal, would not be any less joyful than an Oligarch buying a new yacht...

Andrey (from Greek, "man") sought meaning. Taking the ball of yarn from Baba Yaga, he risked his life and descended to the bottom of the sea to find the treasures he was searching for. The treasures were intact, although Andrey gained scars and prosthetics in the process of descending. He celebrated his discovery in the forest with the birds, trees, wind, and Earth... The treasures were so beautiful that there were no words to describe them. He decided to share them in the best way he could. The treasures remained there, untouched—Andrey no longer needed them, as they are now always with him and no less valuable. The birds and others joined in celebrating the joy of his discovery.

A fairy tale, perhaps a lie, yet within it lies a hint, a lesson for the good fellows.

#### **I Need Your Help**

I am bringing the outlined ideas to life, and if you can help with "forms," advice, feedback, material resources, connections, ideas, and more, I welcome everything. It’s better to discuss things in person beforehand. I specialize in "meanings" and solving "non-standard tasks"; I’m not as strong in "forms."
