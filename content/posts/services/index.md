The company had customer interaction data, but it wasn’t clear how to use it. I developed a recommendation algorithm that, based on the limited data left by the customer, allowed us to make an initial assessment of the likelihood of the person becoming a customer. This allowed more efficient use of the limited resources of the sales department, focusing on those most likely to benefit from interaction with the company.

The startup suddenly lost its main client, <a href=https://www.immobilienscout24.de/>ImmoScout24 GmbH</a>, which on the same day launched a similar product on its website, <a href=https://www.immobilienscout24.de/immobilienmakler>immobilienmakler</a>. As the largest player in the real estate market in Germany and a de facto monopoly, it became clear that the company was doomed unless it quickly changed its business model: the cost of acquiring customers had skyrocketed, the main client left, and that client became the main competitor on its own platform.

The company founders asked all employees for ideas on how to save the business and ensure its survival at this critical moment. We entered the “make it or break it” phase.

I proposed my vision and gave two presentations, one to the entire company. Ultimately, one of my ideas, after some refinement, was chosen as the main strategy. My understanding of both data and business processes played a key role in this situation.

The data was poor: for example, the construction date in some cases was later than the date the object was first entered into the database, with a discrepancy of years. This was just one of many problems. Using another database, I was able to build a model that improved the main database, and then, using methods I developed, trained a final model. It delivered sufficiently good results, allowing us to attract a new client (Skoda GmbH) and open new horizons for the company, including the creation of a new division.

The final refinement of the results was later handled by another data scientist, as the task became more “classical” at that point.

A consulting company with extensive experience in securing such grants prepared the application. I designed and proposed a solution for the technical part of the application, based on cutting-edge approaches (SOTA) and offering innovative solutions. The text of the application was handled by the consulting company.

I was invited to present the technical part of the application to the commission. I proposed my vision of which aspects to emphasize and how to present the material. The commission approved the application for 1.2 million euros on the condition that changes be made to reflect the focus points I had proposed.

At a data conference with many attendees, one guest, instead of asking a question, started promoting their startup. We later crossed paths, and I suggested discussing the situation privately. When he approached me, I pointed out his strategic mistake. In 99% of cases, assertiveness and rule-breaking might work for startups, but not in his case. His company works with super-personal data like medical and financial records, where trust is key. By breaking the rules for profit, he sent the wrong signal. In his business, ethics should come first, not profit. I wasn’t trying to give him a tool for manipulation but rather “held up a mirror” for him to reflect on.

Encoding a list of strings into a numerical representation for machine learning model training, reflecting important business interactions, turned out to be an unsolved problem in public sources. Typically, final categories are encoded, but in my case, I needed to encode a long list of categories (e.g., “equipment” including brake systems, seat quality, and radios). Binary encoding could create 250+ columns with sparse ones and many zeros. I developed an advanced method that encoded the categories into a single column of numbers, representing the values of the respective categories.

#### Mentor - Coach

<b>Facilitator — “Translator”</b>
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
I needed to leave, but I needed permission from someone who wasn’t willing to give it. Around me was a group of people who didn’t fully understand each other, but only I realized this. Using my ability to understand people and see the limits of their understanding, I managed to structure communication so that the vital permission was obtained. My entire future depended on that permission.

I understand people well and often notice things that others miss, stuck in their perceptions of the world and others. This situation can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. Clarity, understanding the other person, and open dialogue — with both parties willing to negotiate — form the basis of mutually beneficial and long-lasting cooperation.

If you need to resolve a conflict, understand someone, or find the right words to be heard, maybe I can help, drawing on my life experience. I don’t use specific methods — my approach is based solely on the task at hand, the context, and the people involved. Everyone has a unique story, their own “personal dictionary” or “language,” where the same words can carry entirely different meanings, emotions, and values. For one, “love” might mean calling or texting every hour, while for another, it’s not bothering them during work. And that’s just one example of how words in a “personal dictionary” can have different meanings depending on context, time of year, mood, and other factors.

Maybe I can be the “translator” between different “personal dictionaries” to help find a “new point” or “angle” on the situation, from which new opportunities and mutually beneficial solutions become visible.

<b>A port for "sinking and lost ships"</b>
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Once there was a boy who grew up in unusual circumstances. He was appreciated when he behaved “properly,” and so he learned to value himself only for his accomplishments. Inside him was an “emptiness” that, as he later found, was only temporarily filled when he did something. At the time, it seemed “cool” to be in the spotlight, to do extraordinary and difficult things, to stand out — and that’s exactly what he did. But the emptiness didn’t go away, and the pain inside didn’t subside. Even sex helped dull the pain temporarily.

That’s how he lived as long as he had the strength to “do,” so as not to accidentally stop and look “inside,” to simply “be.” All this time, he placed his “inner burden” on those around him, which led to the loss of a loved one.

After this, the boy decided that at any cost, he would “clear out” his inner “Augean stables” and build a new life. On this path, he had to “drink and remove” the lake of “acid” and the “well” of “filth,” and even “look death in the face.” Sometimes, to “start living,” you need to look death in the face.

Now this man wants other “children” to be “heard.” He wants to ease their pain and suffering, showing them, with love, possible alternatives and reminding them that everything they need is already inside them, waiting for them. Or direct them to the people and “forces” that helped him, to the “light” that “illuminates the path to oneself and beyond.”

One day, a “girl” came to him, with a “storm” raging inside her, and she needed a “shelter.” “Externally,” this looked like erratic behavior, and she was even sent to a “home for such people.” The man did not judge her but tried to help within his ability and her capacity to “see at that moment” what he was showing. He pointed out the “currents” and “whirlpools” that, perhaps, she shouldn’t “sail into,” and where there were “islands” she could “row” toward.

The man knew there were “forces” that didn’t want “ships” to leave certain “currents” and “whirlpools.” While they were there, these forces could “transport what they needed on those ships,” even if it “sank the boats.” The man challenged these forces, and the “girl’s boat,” in her “storm,” found “understanding, sustenance, and refuge” for further independent sailing. The next day, the man’s “port” was robbed, but that’s how it goes. The main thing is that the “girl’s boat” is now sailing independently, deciding for itself what to “carry” and where to “sail.”
